## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª DESCRIPTION
> welcome to `stats and chats üìä`, a text-analysis and generative text program. this project comes in two parts: `stats.py` and `chats.py`.

> `stats.py`: takes a text and examines its contiguous runs of alphabet characters (or "words"). these "words" are analyzed and returned as a statistical report.
this report includes:
* the word count of the text file
* the number of distinct words
* the top _n_ words ranked by frequency, alongside the # of times they appear
* the number of words that occur exactly once

> `chats.py`: takes a text and analyzes it for "bi-grams" and "tri-grams"-- or strings of words that occur in 2s or 3s. a dictionary is then made for each word storing that words' bi-grams and tri-grams. using this dictionary, a unique text is stochastically generated.
