description:
* you play as a grimtern, or a grim reaper in training (but corporate!). you go around collecting
    souls, killing evil soul snatchers, and exploring the world's various deathy spheres. 

instructions:
* not to be very overseer-like, but just type help!
* i'll add some hints below the point breakdown if y'all want more help :D

point breakdown:
* total: 38 pts
* completed tasks:
    * (2) me command
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/me.gif)
   	* (2) bigger world (there are 6 rooms!)
    * (2) inspect command
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/inspect.gif)
    * (2) drop command
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/drop.gif)
    * (2) weapons (peep the "sickle" and the "DOOM SCYTHE")
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/attack.gif)
    * (2) armor (peep the "edgy black cloak" and the "ULTIMATE ARMOR")
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/cloak-attack.gif)
    * (2) healing items (bandaids!)
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/heal.gif)
    * (2) limited inventory (the limit is 30 units)
    * (2) regeneration (<50% of regenerating 1 health pt. if time passes)
    * (3) locked doors (you can't enter the grim hq w/o swipe access)

![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/unlock.gif)
    * (3) loot (canned tuna, duct tape)
    * (3) special rooms (the hospital reduces your health as time passes...)
    * (3) victory condition (collecting all 5 souls, killing the final boss, agreeing to a promotion offer from the "GRIM REAPER")
    * (4) character (the "GRIM REAPER")
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/chat-and-victory-condition.gif) 
    * (4) craft (making the "ULTIMATE ARMOR")
![](https://github.com/00eemsy/csci-121-projects/blob/main/adventure/craft.gif)
* extra things i did (no point values, just wanted to mention them!):
    * i made the monsters stop moving to create a final boss scenario !
    * i created a Narration class to allow the overseer to guide the player from *above* !
    * i also edited most of the small error messages/item descriptions/etc. to make it more immersive (i.e. the overseer's being grumpy and a tad bit degrading...)


hints:
* the final boss will be hard to beat if you attack it w/o the proper equipment (weapons, bandaids, armor)
* my fav: "ULTIMATE ARMOR" makes you unable to die. what's the recipe to craft it? just 1 canned tuna and 1 duct tape, or rather both of the loot types a monster can drop.
* gain grim hq swipe access by killing the FINAL BOSS SOUL SNATCHER
